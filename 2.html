        <h2>PLAYSTYLE</h2>
        <img src="tikitaka.jpg" width="100%">
        <p>Cruyff was the beginning of the tactical era for barcelona. Though they wouldnâ€™t play short passing like the way Guardiola used to, they played more directly. 
           They played with three at the back predominantly, this is because he liked to keep as many defenders as forwards( i.e. as few as he could). In his system, the number 4 was one of the most important, as he would recycle the ball between the defenders and the rest of the midfield and play it out wide into more space. 
           This system asked the players to widen the pitch and create spaces while attacking while it required players to play narrow while defending. Controlling possession and tempo of the game was utmost priority and they would press urgently upon loosing the ball.</p>
