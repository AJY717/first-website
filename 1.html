        <h2>HISTORY</h2>
        <img src="Barcelona.jpg" width="100%">
        <p>In 1899 Joan Gamper, a Swiss man, decided to introduce football to Barcelona by setting up a team. The club was officially founded on 29th November 1899.
            It grew from strength to strength, winning titles such as the Macaya Cup in 1902, the Pyrenees Cup in 1910 - 1912.
            Barcelona FC built their first stadium in 1909 with a capacity of 6,000 people.
            During the 1920's the team's fame and success grew. They won the first Championship League in the 1928 - 1929 season. With the club's new popularity it was necessary to build a new stadium. In 1922 the 'Les Corts' stadium was built, with a capacity of 22,000 people.
            <br>It is important to remember that Barcelona FC has survived a Civil War. In 1936 Franco's troops shot the club president, Josep Sunyol due to his membership of a left wing party.
            All Barcelona FC fans are proud of what is called the 'Five Cups' Season. This was the period between 1951 - 1952 when Barcelona FC won the Cup, the League, the Latin Cup, the Martini Rosso and the Eva Duarte.
            In 1957 Camp Nou was built, with an initial capacity of 90,000 people.</p>
